## sales_forecast_learn

Sales forecast script that predicts the sales of an individual store for the upcoming 6 weeks. 

The best thing about this script is that at the end of the project you will be able to access the predictions directly from your mobile phone, through the Telegram app!

This is a project dedicated to training my DS skills. ThatÂ´s why you'll find variations of the same file. Each variation represents a phase of the project.
